# TraQR
This project originated during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.  After our UCSB campus had been essentially closed for several months during the initial statewide stay-at-home orders, campus was investigating options for limited re-opening of the UCSB campus to some limited research staff while at the same time allowing essential and critical staff to get work done.  The problem was coming up with a methodology to  provide a means of regulating access to the various locations and at the same time provide some assistance if contact tracing was required.  This translated to a means of quickly and easily logging users ingress to and egress from campus facilities and buildings.  A campus app had been created to scan QR codes at the entrances and exits of various spaces on campus.  But the tools initial release had several shortcomings, the most major being:
* App could not be installed on older phones
* Data had to be harvested centrally to be distributed to end points that might need it
  * The data collection was manually intensive and prone to error

This project began as a quick proof of concept for generating custom QR codes for Individuals specific to Building and Room; something that we could manage locally for our Department/Building.  The project quickly ballooned into something that looked like it might be a viable solution to the problem.
