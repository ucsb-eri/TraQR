# TraQR
This project originated during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.  In trying to re-open the UCSB campus to some limited research use, we were looking for a means to quickly and easily log users ingress to and egress from campus facilities/buildings.  A campus app had been created to scan QR codes at the entrances and exits of various spaces on campus.  But the tool had several shortcomings, the most major being:
* App could not be installed on older phones
* Data had to be harvested centrally to be distributed to end points that might need it
  * The data collection was manually intensive and prone to error

This project began as a quick proof of concept for generating custom QR codes for Individuals specific to Building and Room; something that we could manage locally for our Department/Building.  The project quickly ballooned into something that looked like it might be a viable solution to the problem.
